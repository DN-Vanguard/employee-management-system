## Installation

`Node.js` is required on your local machine to run this app.
You can then run it in VSCode and open an `integrated terminal` of the root folder.
Before use, run `npm install` or `npm i` (for short) to load any dependencies such as Inquirer and mySQL2 to the folder.

The gitignore provided will bypass the original `.env` file, therefore, in the root folder create a `.env` file and paste this line of code changing password to your MySQL root user password: `DB_PASS=password`.

To setup the database, login to the MySQL shell using `mysql -u root -p` and then run the schema file with `source db/schema.sql`.

You may use the `seeds.sql` file provided to populate example tables to the database or clear the database and add your own data.
